This game is modelled on the original Max Walker's Cricket Game which came out in the 80's.
It was a dice cricket game with historical teams. There were Batting & Bowling charts, 
Loose Ball cards and each day of the Test match required a new Match Conditions card to be drawn.
I've tried to include all of those dynamics in this computerised version. 

To run launch the file max_walker_cricket_game.py from the command line.
Teams are stored in saved_teams.csv, and player database is all_test_players.csv
All files need to be in the same folder to run.
There is also an exe file which is untested on other than the development machine.
